## Requirements

To get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with the basics of web development, which includes knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/) mentions several things that should be kinda familiar regarding JavaScript before you start to read this book. You will also need to be familiar with the term API, which I explained [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/), because APIs are used frequently for the applications in this book.

### Editor/Terminal or IDE

For the development environment, use a running editor/terminal (command line tool) or IDE with integrated terminal. [Follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/) if you're unsure about which tools to use. The guide is set up for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide there as well.

### Node and NPM

You will need to have [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which are used to run the applications we'll build and manage the libraries we'll use along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks. You can verify which node and npm versions you have in the command line:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
node --version
*v10.11.0
npm --version
*v6.5.0
~~~~~~~

These are the versions used for this publication. If you don't see output in your terminal, you will need to install node and npm.

### React

My other book, called The Road to learn React, teaches the fundamentals about React by building a real world application. It is available for free, and after having read it, you should possess all the understanding necessary to work with the application(s) from this book. Also there will be many sidenotes to React articles that may be helpful.
