# Introduction

Modern web applications are often bloated and complex when they're implemented as full-blown client-server architectures. There are usually a frontend application, a backend application with a database, and an interface that lets both ends communicate with each other. In my other courses and books I teach about React.js for frontend applications, Node.js for backend applications with databases, and GraphQL or REST for the communication between them. Doing all of this yourself can be a lengthy endeavor though, so if you're looking for a stop-gap solution, Firebase offers a database, authentication, authorization and hosting by default to replace your entire backend application tech stack.

The React with Firebase application we'll build in this book offered a solid foundation for my own business for a long time. It also taught me the fundamentals of databases, authentication, and authorization from a frontend developer's perspective. Also I learned how a well-designed API has to look like in case I would ever design an API for a backend application myself. These are the main reasons I wanted to pass my understanding of React and Firebase along. If you choose to go with this minimal tech stack, you don't need to worry about a backend application yourself. Firebase takes care of it while you can spend more time implementing your frontend React application.

There are plenty of newcomers to React who are proficient with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, who have learned React to build modern web applications, but haven't learned how to create backend applications for deeper business logic or how to connect a React application to a database. React itself can be sufficient for new JavaScript developers being frontend developers, so I often recommend Firebase, since it is a good foundation before learning more about backend applications and databases. It takes you a step closer to building full-stack applications, allowing you to build sophisticated applications with a minimalistic tech stack.

There are also the more experienced crowd who want to bootstrap their ideas as businesses. However, using only React may not be sufficient for an application that needs a database, authentication, authorization, and hosting. Essentially, some have the right ideas but lack the tools to create a MVP (Minimal Viable Product). After I published my initial Firebase in React tutorial, I heard many success stories from those who built successful businesses on top of it, so I wanted to offer this foundation for profitable business applications with React.

After Firebase was purchased by Google in 2014, it became even a more go-to tool to replace backend applications using authentication, authorization, database management, and hosting. In this book, you'll build a real world application with user management to power your ideas. You'll learn how to create a well-rounded authentication flow with sign in (login), sign up (registration) and sign out (logout). We'll also cover features to improve the UX like resetting and changing the password of authenticated users and social logins with Google, Facebook and Twitter. To prevent just anyone from being able to access the application, you will learn about authorization rules that protect certain areas of your web applications from non-authenticated users. You'll interact with Firebase's database to manage users and other entities, such as messages for a chat application, and learn how to structure data in Firebase's database and interact with it. Finally, you will be able to implement full-fledged web applications without worrying about a backend application or database using only React with Firebase.

Firebase is an ideal fit for transitioning to full-stack business application development. It comes with features you would otherwise have to implement yourself, and lets you experience how a well-built interface (API) should perform before you implement it yourself for a RESTful or GraphQL server application eventually. Firebase lets you focus on building well-rounded React applications using their APIs. My hope is that this book illustrates the enthusiasm I have for a minimalistic tech stack that lets you build large-scale applications without taking care about the backend application yourself.
